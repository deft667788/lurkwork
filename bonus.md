For this job, I've added a throttling function located in utils.js.  The primary purpose is to limit the number of times a function can be executed in a period of time.

It is a technique to limit how often a function is executed.  By throttling, we can ensure that a function is executed at most once in a period rather than multiple times in a row.
The main functions of throttling are as follows:

1. Reduced performance overhead
2. Avoid wasted resources
3. Optimize user experience

In summary, throttling is a way to balance performance and real-time responsiveness that can help us optimize performance, save resources, and provide a better user experience.
